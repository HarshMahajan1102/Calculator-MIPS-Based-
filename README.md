# 🧮 MIPS-Based Calculator

A terminal-based calculator written in **MIPS Assembly Language** that supports both **integer** and **floating-point** operations. This project helps in understanding low-level programming, system calls, register usage, and control flow in MIPS.

## 📌 Features

### ✅ Integer Operations
- `+` Addition  
- `-` Subtraction  
- `*` Multiplication  
- `/` Division (with zero-division handling)  
- `^` Exponentiation (max exponent = 15)  
- `%` Modulus (with zero-division handling)  
- `!` Factorial (max input = 12; negative values not allowed)

### ✅ Floating-Point Operations
- `+` Addition  
- `-` Subtraction  
- `*` Multiplication  
- `/` Division (with zero-division handling)

### 🔁 Navigation Options
- `m` Go back to the Number Type Menu (integer/float)
- `q` Quit the calculator safely
